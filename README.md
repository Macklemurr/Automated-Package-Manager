## Description

Easily update, maintain, and clean your package manager with this bash script

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Linux (Arch, but you can modify it to fit any distribution)
* Any kind of Shell (Bash, zsh, csh, etc.)

### Installing

* Download this folder to your Home Directory, then make a symbolic link of autopacman.sh to your environment, usually located in /usr/local/bin (at least for me) but that may vary. do echo $PATH to find your local environment path.
* Alternatively, you could just place both files in /usr/local/bin/ directory and change the $file variable, either works.
* After you set it as a local or global script, then you are able to run it normally. It should automatically search for the file with the variables and function.
